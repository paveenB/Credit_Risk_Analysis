# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  The project is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.  Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we will take a look out the outcomes of different sampling models.
